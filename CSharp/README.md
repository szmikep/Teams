# Microsoft Teams Get Started Sample in .NET/C#

This app simulates connection to a project management system and allows users and teams to create, manage and search tasks. The content is randomly generated to simulate what you can do with Teams.

This .NET/C# sample only shows the Bot and Compose Extension portion of the sample.  As the Tab and Connector work is web code unrelated to the bot service, we provide a hosted version of that code for this sample, built from the project's Node.js codebase.  For more information on the Tab and Connector support in this sample, please review the [Node repository](../Node/readme.md)

**For more information on developing apps for Microsoft Teams, please review the Microsoft Teams [developer documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/index).**
